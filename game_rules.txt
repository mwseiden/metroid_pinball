Starting The Game

    When you first start a ball you will be asked to choose your landing site.
    The default selection will be randomly selected per game and will be the
    same initial selection for each player. Use the flipper buttons to change
    modes. You can begin your turn at one of 5 different regions of the map.
    Each site is a different mode.

        Crateria
        Brinstar
        Wrecked Ship
        Maridia
        Norfair

    On every ball except the first, you will have the opportunity to choose to
    continue playing in the room where you left off. This allows you to keep
    your progress towards deeper rooms in the map.


Skillshots

    Side Targets:
        Shooting the flashing orange side bank awards points.

    Missile Targets:
        Shooting the left missile bank roving light will award points and one
        missile.

    Miniboss Targets:
        Shooting the roving shot on the miniboss targets awards points.

    Power Bomb Targets:
        Shooting the roving shot on the power bomb targets awards points and
        one power bomb.

    Drop Targets:
        Shooting the moving drop target awards points. Further back targets
        are worth more. The game will attempt to hold the ball behind the next
        lower drop target if you hit the middle or rear target. A countdown
        will begin and afterwards the ball will be released for a super
        skillshot up the side ramp.

    Emergency Landing:
        Drain the ball down the center without hitting a switch or flipping.
        If you finish your ball without hitting either outlane switch then
        you will be awarded Emergency Landing points during your bonus.

    Zero Suit Target:
        Shooting the strobing Zero Suit target awards points.

Base Game Mechanics

    Chozo Multiball:
        Bash the captive ball to lock balls for Chozo multiball. Chozo will
        start immediately once the require balls are locked. This is a three
        ball multiball. The rest of the game will continue to play as normal
        during Chozo multiball (with a couple of exceptions)

        All doors will be closed and you will be locked into your room mode.

        Jackpot shots will be strobing red. Hitting a jackpot shot will award
        points and build up your super jackpot value.

        The super jackpot is collected in the VUK behind the drops. At the
        start of Chozo all the drops will fall and start to stobe purple. The
        more jackpots hit before collecting the super jackpot will increase
        the value of this shot. It starts low compared to the jackpots.

        The super jackpot will be physically impossible to hit during
        controlled play without staging the upper flipper.

        There is a timed ball saver during Chozo.

        Chozo ends once a single ball remains.

    Missiles:
        Collect missiles by completing the lower left, small standup bank.
        This adds to your bonus and allows you to open RED doors.

    Power Bombs:
        Collect a power bomb by completing the right standup bank. This adds
        to your bonus and is used to destroy the bridge.

    Destroy Bridges:
        The bridge can be destroyed with a power bomb. To reach the bridge
        you must hit the center upper lane. The required power bombs will be
        subtracted from your total and will no longer count towards bonus.

        When the bridge is destroyed the ball will be returned to the shooter
        lane and another skillshot will be awarded. A skillshot will not be
        awarded during multiball, or if the ball falls off and never reaches
        the shooter lane! (sorry)

    Scanner:
        The center scanner insert will strobe in a direction. Whichever
        direction it points will increase scoring for that section of the
        playfield. The direction is changed clockwise in sync with spinner
        hits.

    Pop Bumpers:
        Scores points. Getting it in the subway scores points too. There is a
        Pop Champ that you can win for the most pop bumper hits.

    Orbits:
        Scores points. There is an Orbit Champ that you can win for the most
        orbit hits.

    Zero Suit Target:
        Scores points. If you can shatz the target then Samus will give you
        the thumbs up and you'll score even more points.

    Inlanes and Outlanes:
        Completing the lower lanes turns on the virtual kickback. They also
        count towards the Lane Champ score.

    Upper Lanes:
        Complete each lane 3 times to light upper lane modes.

        Once the modes are lit, shooting the upper playfield via the VUK
        will select a new mode.
        
        You start a mode by shooting the side ramp.
        
        These lanes also count towards Lane Champ.

    Secret Passage:
        Scores points.

    Ramps:
        Scores points. There is a Ramp Champ that you can win for the most
        ramp hits.
        
        Hit the back ramp 10 times to start high jump mode.

        Hitting the captive ball, ricocheting to the upper flipper, then
        hitting the side ramp awards the Cap-Side combo. This gives extra
        points and adds to your bonus.

    Drop Targets:
        Block the VUK. Each room has an initial starting state for which
        targets are up or down. Hitting a drop target will cause it to
        remain down for that room for the remainder of the game.

    Miniboss Targets:
        Complete three banks, red, orange, and green. Afterwards the scoop
        will be lit. Hitting the scoop resets to the begining. Score points
        for each hit and completion. More points are scored the further you
        get. But when it resets so do the points.

    Side Targets:
        Scores points when hit and more points when complete.

    Slingshots:
        Scores points. There is a Sling Champ that you can win for the most
        slingshot hits.

    The Pit:
        The big hole behind the scoop. Scores points when hit. Feeds the
        scoop.

    Star Rollover:
        Scores points.

    Doors:
        Doors are how you change modes in game and travel further into the
        planet to fight bosses. Doors are shots with certain solid colors.
        There are a few types of doors and each has a different requirement in
        order to pass through them.

        Blue:
            No special requirement. Hitting the shot will travel to another
            room and start (or continue) that new mode.

        Red:
            Requires one missile. The missile is lost after use. The door will
            become a BLUE door for the rest of the game.
